# Comprehensive Analysis Report

## Executive Summary
This report provides a multi-angle analysis of the query: "{original_query}". The analysis was conducted through {len(responses)} different analytical perspectives, each providing unique insights into the topic.

## Key Findings
Based on the multi-angle analysis, the following key findings emerged:

1. **Primary Insights**: The analysis reveals multiple dimensions of the topic, each contributing valuable perspectives.

2. **Cross-Angle Themes**: Common themes identified across different analytical angles include:
   - Comprehensive coverage of the topic
   - Multiple stakeholder perspectives
   - Both current state and future implications

3. **Data Quality**: All responses showed high confidence levels and comprehensive coverage.

## Detailed Analysis
Each analytical angle provided specific insights:

"""
        
        for i, response in enumerate(responses, 1):
            mock_report += f"""
### Angle {i}: {response['angle']}
**Response**: {response['content'][:200]}...

**Key Insights**: This angle provided valuable insights into the specific aspect of the query, contributing to the overall understanding of the topic.

"""
        
        mock_report += f"""
## Contradictions or Inconsistencies
No significant contradictions were identified between the different analytical angles. All responses were complementary and provided different perspectives on the same topic.

## Recommendations or Next Steps
Based on this comprehensive analysis, the following recommendations are suggested:

1. **Further Research**: Consider deeper investigation into specific aspects identified by the analysis
2. **Stakeholder Engagement**: Engage with relevant stakeholders based on the different perspectives identified
3. **Monitoring**: Establish monitoring mechanisms for the trends and developments identified

## Confidence Assessment
Overall confidence in this analysis: **High (90%)**
- All analytical angles provided comprehensive responses
- No significant contradictions were identified
- Multiple perspectives were successfully integrated
